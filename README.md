# Labdoo 3.0
### Moving the Labdoo platform to Drupal 9/10
This project is the Labdoo 3.0 source code base for the Labdoo platform using Drupal 9 (and eventually Drupal 10).

You can install and develop locally using DDEV or entirely in the Cloud using Gitpod.

## Installing and developing locally using DDEV
### Prerequisites:
1. [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which itself requires
2. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)

Once those are installed and this repository is cloned, from the project root you cloned the repository into, start the DDEV environment using the command
`ddev start`

Remembering to prefix most commands like composer, drush, etc with ddev.
## Developing entirely in the cloud using Gitpod.
### Video Demo

### Prerequisites:
1. [Sign up for gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io/login)

### Try it out:
1. Click on the following link
  https://gitpod.io/#hhttps://github.com/greggmarshall/Labdoo-3.0
1. Your environment is being prepared, wait about 40 seconds (A splash screen will appear)
1. VScode IDE will be displayed, a few seconds later you will see Umami demo.
1. Run in terminal `ddev xdebug on`
1. Open VScode's debugger, place a new breakpoint in `web/index.php`
1. Open your website's URL in a browser.
1. :tada:

### Do you like PhpStorm instead of Theia or VScode?
1. Open a bash window at the bottom
2. `.ddev/run-phpstorm.sh`

### How does it work?
1. Gitpod - development environment based on Docker
    1. [.gitpod.yml](https://github.com/shaal/ddev-gitpod/blob/main/.gitpod.yml)
        1. Defines the main docker image this environment is built on - `.gitpod.Dockerfile`
        1. Run prebuild commands:
            1. Start ddev
            1. Run `composer install`
            1. Install Umami demo website
    1. [.gitpod.Dockerfile](https://github.com/shaal/ddev-gitpod/blob/main/.gitpod.Dockerfile)
        1. Set base image to Gitpod's `workspace-full` ([link](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/tree/master/full))
        1. Install ddev using brew
1. ddev - ridiculously simple setup for complex development environments, allows developers working locally or working with Gitpod in the cloud.
    1. [.ddev/config.yaml](https://github.com/shaal/ddev-gitpod/blob/main/.ddev/config.yaml) - main ddev (default) configuration, can be generated by running `ddev config`

### Thank you
[@rfay](https://github.com/rfay) for your endless patience and relentless support that made this project possible.

#### Persistent Storage:
* Gitpod backs up the state of the `/workspace/` folder between workspace starts, so that you can revisit them later. Attention: Files in other locations will not be saved!
