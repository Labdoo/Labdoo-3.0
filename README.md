# Labdoo-3.0

This is the Labdoo 3.0 source code base.

To install the Labdoo platform, run the lbd-install.sh script on a Debian system (e.g., Ubuntu): 

$ ./lbd-install.sh

(Note: it is recommended that you add your developer user to the sudo list by running this command: 'sudo usermod -aG sudo YOURUSERNAME')

This will take care of everything, including installing MYSQL, PHP, Apache, Composer, Drupal, Drush, and all Labdoo modules,
as well as configuring the base installation.

After running the above command, open your web browser and go to the URL http://www.labdoo-dev.org/. (Alternatively, http://localhost.)
This should take you to your fresh installation of the Labdoo platform. You can login using the 'admin' account and 
the password 'grassroots'.
